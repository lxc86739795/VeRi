## Abstract
Compared with person re-identification, which has concentrated attention, vehicle re-identification is an important yet frontier problem in video surveillance and has been neglected by the multimedia and vision communities. 
Since most existing approaches mainly consider the general vehicle appearance for re-identification while overlooking the distinct vehicle identifier, such as the license number plate, they attain suboptimal performance. 
In this paper, we propose PROVID, a PROgressive Vehicle re-IDentification framework based on deep neural networks. 
In particular, our framework not only utilizes the multi-modality data in large-scale video surveillance, such as visual features, license plates, camera locations, and contextual information, but also considers vehicle re-identification in two progressive procedures: coarse-to-fine search in the feature domain, and near-to-distant search in the physical space. 
Furthermore, to evaluate our progressive search framework and facilitate related research, we construct the VeRi dataset, which is the most comprehensive dataset from real-world surveillance videos.
It not only provides large numbers of vehicles with varied labels and sufficient cross-camera recurrences but also contains license number plates and contextual information. 
Extensive experiments on the VeRi dataset demonstrate both the accuracy and efficiency of our progressive vehicle re-identification framework.

## VeRi dataset
To facilitate the research of vehicle re-identification (Re-Id), we build a large-scale benchmark dateset for vehicle Re-Id in the real-world urban surveillance scenario, named "VeRi". The featured properties of VeRi include:
* It contains over 50,000 images of 776 vehicles captured by 20 cameras covering an 1.0 km^2 area in 24 hours, which makes the dataset scalable enough for vehicle Re-Id and other related research. 
* The images are captured in a real-world unconstrained surveillance scene and labeled with varied attributes, e.g. BBoxes, types, colors, and brands. So complicated models can be learnt and evaluated for vehicle Re-Id.
* Each vehicle is captured by 2 ∼ 18 cameras in different viewpoints, illuminations, resolutions, and occlusions, which provides high recurrence rate for vehicle Re-Id in practical surveillance environment.
* It is also labeled with sufficient license plates and spatiotemporal information, such as the BBoxes of plates, plate strings, the timestamps of vehicles, and the distances between neighbouring cameras.

## Application
One US patent, ‘Progressive vehicle searching method and device’ (US 15350813), was granted in 2018. 

This technique has been applied to the Intelligent Transportation Big Data Platform of Beijing Boyotod Technology Co., Ltd. (the subsidiary technical corporation of Beijing Capital Highway Development Group Co., Ltd.).
It has been deployed on several expressways including the G1 Jingha Expressway, the G6 Jingzang Expressway and the S12 Airport South Expressway.

## Codes
Here we give an example code for vehicle search evaluation.

In this code, we should first get the distance matrix of all query images and test images.
As in the example code, we have three distance matrixes obtained with SIFT-BOW, CN-BOW, CNN features seperately.
Then these matrixes are summed with different weights to obtain the final "dist" matrix.

Then we read the ground truth and junk image index (the test images that have the same camera ID with the query image, they are not considered when computing the AP) from the gt_image.txt and jk_image.txt.

After that, for each query, we rank the distance to each test image and compute the Average Presicion using the compute_AP function.
At last, we can obtain the mAP, HIT@1, HIT@5, and the CMC curves.
